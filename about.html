			<h1>who we are</h1>
			<p>Xenophos is the result of the ongoing collaboration between Alex Lenail and Bradford Thorne, and a number of student artists from and around Palo Alto High School in California. Armed with home-made light apparatuses, we've sought to prove that lightpainting is more than just a curiosity but an art in its own right.

			<h1>what we do</h1>
			<p>Lightpainting is long exposure photography in a dark context with interpretive waving of lights. Cameras typically capture moments with a shutter opening for a fraction of a second, but when that same shutter is opened for much longer spans of time, one image can capture trails of light, brushstrokes to a lightpainter.

		<p class="hidden info">Hi, <br><br> My name is Alex and I put together Xenophos and this website. <br><br> I'm a Computer Science major at Tufts University, but that was not where I expected to end up. I've dabbled a little in everything -- I was a nationally ranked Policy Debater in high school and co-founded a foreign affairs journal, but I was also a professional glassblower and photographer. I'm fluent in English, French, and Spanish, as well as C, C++, and Javascript. I decided to major in CS because I think it provides the most direct avenue to catalyze major change in the world, and positively impact the lives of many.</p>

		<p class="hidden info"> Hi, <br><br> I'm Bradford. <br><br> I study neuroscience and computer science at Purdue University. At school, I sing Bass in the Lafayette Chamber Singers and dance competitively with the Purdue Latin and Ballroom Dance Team. When on campus, my research is conducted in the Purdue Molecular Virology lab studying viral assembly with the goal of visualizing viral genome packing and assembly in the complex environment of the cell via electron microscope tomography. When in sunny California, I do research at the UCSF interventional radiology research lab with current focuses on the Magnetically-assisted remote control (MARC) catheter for MRI interventions as well as the ChemoFilter for high-dose chemotherapy delivery via transcatheter intra arterial chemotherapy. <br><br> Current photography interests include timelapse, starscape, MRI portraiture, and lightpainting, In my free time, I like to cook, climb, road and mountain bike, swim, compete in triathlons, backpack, play ultimate Frisbee, and build moderately useful contraptions. I also dabble in jazz piano, bagpipes, and cowbell, though the proficiency of my dabbling is often called into question. I am a huge fan of girls.</p>

		<p class="hidden info">Hey there,<br><br> I'm Max Lenail, one of the photographers in the Xenophos group. I am currently a student at Palo Alto High School, where I play soccer and ultimate frisbee, as well as do debate. However, my adventure in light-painting started when I was in Middle school, where I was lucky enough to join a group of awesome people with an awesome idea. I've always loved photography. When I was younger, it was an exciting activity to do on vacations, where I would use Kodak disposable cameras to capture anything I found cool or interesting. When I got my first digital camera, I really got into it, and started to not only take photos during trips, but also around the house, or in my neighborhood. It was after my trip to Nicaragua, when I got my first DSLR, that I began to think of photography in a different way, as more than just a convenient way to immortalize memories. I started taking pictures for their artistic value, as opposed to just what was in the frame. When my brother, Alex, showed me an online tutorial on how to do basic light-painting, I was thrilled. I thought it would be a great way to learn all the features of my camera, and I was right. We started fooling around with glow-sticks and flashlights, and soon discovered that we had found something really special. Alex got a group of his friends together, build some awesome tools, and the rest is in our photos. In the end, I am so grateful and happy that I was a part of this group, as I wouldn't be half the photographer I am today without it. </p>

		<h1 class="hidden Name">Anna McGarrigle</h1>
		<p class="hidden info">Hi, <br><br>I'm Anna. <br><br>Art became a chief interest of mine after my father left me in my room with a box of acrylic paints and found me hours later surrounded by four walls covered in mini-murals dictated by my overzealous imagination. Since then, my medium has narrowed to digital art; designing, photographing and writing for an assortment of newspapers and magazines has sharpened my interests. Over the past two years, working with the Xenophos crew has greatly developed not only my passion but also my experience as a photographer. Before Xenophos, I never would have considered photography to be a group effort, but our productive teamwork and friendship show how working together allows us to develop from each other. <br><br>Here at the George Washington University, I study Anthropology and Fine Arts. I also write and design for the GW Hatchet, bringing my current studies inside and outside of the classroom back to art.</p>

		<p class="hidden info">Hi,<br><br>I'm Masha<br><br>I’ve been visually inclined since I was five years old, when I was better at understanding Art Nouveau books than I was at English. In 8th grade I picked up my mom’s Konica Minolta with all of its endless buttons, and thus began my adventures with SLRs. I’ve dabbled into darkroom photography, Photoshop, and a variety of exposure techniques, also growing a parallel affinity for design, as I created little projects in Illustrator and worked on putting together an arts magazine. Somewhere in there at an art show, I met Alex and Bradford who drew me in to be fascinated with light manipulation and all of the ideas, laughs, and frozen yogurt trips that came along with it. My work with Xenophos brought me delight, skill, and direction to my current project—college, that is. I now study Cognitive Science and Design at UC Berkeley, with a focus in human-centered design and innovation.</p>

		<p class="hidden info">I am a student at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. My professional interests include issues of computer networking and security, but I mainly provide logistical support to Xenophos, helping to get things in the right place at the right time, working correctly. Additionally, I do some work exploring locations for projects, generally in Northern California. Much of what I do consists of working with things of very limited aesthetic value--texts, journals, and essays relating to abstract and generally intangible subjects. Since much of what I do is so colorless, working with Xenophos is as much a way to balance my life as it is a way to advance photography.</p>

				<p>Lightpainting is exactly what it sounds like: painting with light. <br><br>What makes it dissimilar from regular painting is that instead of being confined to some rectangular two-dimensional space, lightpainting is inherently a 3 dimensional art (much more alike to dancing than drawing). In lightpainting, the world is your canvas, and the brushstrokes are any sort of motion you can come up with. <br><br>Lightpainting can also be conceived in part as the antithesis of what you might do with oils or watercolor: they depend on light to take on meaning and form, whereas lightpainting only ever works in the dark. A painting in an unlit space isn't a painting to the viewer, and a lightpainting exposed to daylight is just some crazies waving sticks around. But enough metaphor, what is it actually? <br><br>Lightpainting is long exposure photography in a dark setting, paired with light in motion during the span of the shot. The basic anatomy of a lightpainting shoot is a photographer with a camera on a tripod set to optimized parameters taking a 10-30 second photo of one or more lightpainters waving light-tools or "brushes" within the frame and timeframe of the shot. I'm going to break that down for you below to give you an idea of each of the important pieces before you can go out and do it yourself.<br></p>

			<h1 class="title" id="light-tools">Lights</h1>
			<p id="light-tools-text">Every part of lightpainting is in some way an art, and choosing your tools is no different. We at Xenophos built our own tools, but not from scratch. There are a few categories of tools which we built, described below. <br><br></p>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/sticks.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Light Sticks</h2>
				<p class="">These are the some of the simplest and best tools. We bought the lights for about $5 apiece at Fry's electronics and attached them with duct tape to some old wood we cut and sanded to our liking. <br><br></p>
				<h2 class="" id=""><br>The Light Staves</h2>
				<p class="">These are the tools most unique to our work which took a long time to put together. We started with pairs of Cold Cathodes and wired them up to sets of 8 AA batteries each, and a switch, which took a lot of soldering. Then we mounted those structures with hot glue and duct tape onto long rectangular pieces of wood, and added a duct-tape handle. <br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="staves" class="" src="images/about/tools/staves2.jpg" />
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/whip.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The EL Whip</h2>
				<p class="">Electrofluorescent wire is used for plenty of lighting applications. In our case, we took a strand of it and cut it into sections, soldered them all together to take power from one source, and mounted that onto a piece of wood which all together resembled a short EL 'whip' of 12 18-inch strands of wire. When we shake them in a shot, they look like static fire. <br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/steel-wool.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Steel Wool Spinner</h2>
				<p class=""> This tool is made from a whisk attached to a cooking spoon by some wire. We put the steel wool (which you can find at your local hardware store) in the whisk and light it with a 9V battery and spin the sparks out. Be careful not to use this tool near highly flammable things! The spinning generates a lot of sparks. Wear Jeans and a sweatshirt when using this tool -- the sparks sting. <br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/floodlight.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Floodlight</h2>
				<p class="">This tool is used to light up the scene entirely, typically for a very brief moment, in order to capture the way things are before changing them. This process is kind of like a camera flash, and in lightpainting, it's a way of cheating by actually getting a static image and then painting on top of it.<br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/orb.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Sphere Tool</h2>
				<p class="">This tool is a few LEDs attached to a string attached to a handle, which when spun while walking in a circle, generates a beautiful orb of color. We've also done this with a fiber optic light instead of an LED at the end of the string. <br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>		

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/saber.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Lightsaber</h2>
				<p class="">We didn't modify this tool at all, because it worked exactly the way we wanted it to. Take out those old lightsabers from your childhood and use them to paint with light!<br><br></p>

			<p id="actionText">Each of the tools comes with an implicit effect, and that effect is made by using the tool in the particular way it's built to be used. However, do not be constrained by the way we learned to use our tools. Functional fixedness is not a part of lightpainting, and we discover new ways to use our tools as we go.<br><br>In any case, below I'll describe how we used our tools, and you can borrow our ideas or come up with your own. <br><br></p>

			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Spinning steel wool</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Take the steel wool out of the bag and rip it apart a little, for better oxygen flow.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Put the steel wool in the whisk. Set the focus for the camera to when you will be spinning. Stand right behind that location.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>3.</b>&nbsp Light the steel wool with a 9V battery by rubbing the battery electrodes against the wool. For best results spend about two seconds rubbing both sides of the wool.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>4.</b>&nbsp Start spinning the wool and start the camera at the same time. Spin hard, but not as hard as you can. Try to stay motionless and only spin your wrist/forearm. Spin the wool in front of you, not right next to you. <br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/portfolio/lightpainting/21.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Orbs</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Set the camera focus. <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Start spinning before you take the photo, with your dominant arm offsef from your body.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>3.</b>&nbsp Once you start the shot, begin walking in a circle arounf your hand. Try to keep your hand over the same spot on the ground the entire time.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>4.</b>&nbsp Walk until you've completed a half circle, or a full circle for a brighter orb. <br></p>
			</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/portfolio/lightpainting/23.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Freeform light staves</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Set focus.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Use two light staves interpretively. The less you move the more clear you will be in the shot. Release your inner Jedi! <br></p>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/portfolio/lightpainting/12.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Arachnids</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Set the focus.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Have someone stand in the center and someone with the floodlight outside of the camera frame but capable of lighting the person up. <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>3.</b>&nbsp Start the shot and have the person being the arachnid slowly lift their arms around them while the person with the floodlight strobes the light the desired number of times.  <br></p>

			<img id="" class="aboutImage" src="images/about/Alex2.jpg" />
			<h1 class="title" id="actionTitle">Setting</h1>
			<div id="settingText">
				<h2 class="" id="">Nature</h2>
				<p class="">Go out into the woods and paint gentle light around trees, meadows, and streams. <br></p>
				<h2 class="" id="">Underground</h2>
				<p class="">We found an extraordinary setting in some local abandoned tunnels plastered with graffiti, which gave our paintings an implicit frame. <br></p>
				<h2 class="" id="">Urban</h2>
				<p class="">These are hard to find but look incredible when lightpainted against. Many of our inspirations (below) make incredible use of these settings. <br></p>

				<p class="" id=""><br>Just one last note: we believe that lightpainting doesn't lend itself too well to solo work. It's a great deal more powerful and meaningful done with others. <br><br>On one level, you need someone behind the camera and someone painting, and performing both at once is challenging. On another level, the complexity of the shot is limited when you only have one painter. But most importantly, art is meant to be shared. It's a vehicle to explore another's consciousness, a way to connect. I've been amazed by some of the paintings my friends had hidden away inside their heads, expressed in a sort of unique dance, a cognitive fingerprint of theirs, of which the traces are superimposed onto one another in the form of an image. We've had so much fun doing this together, and you should too!<br><br></p>
