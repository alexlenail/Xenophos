				<p>Lightpainting is exactly what it sounds like: painting with light. <br><br>What makes it dissimilar from regular painting is that instead of being confined to some rectangular two-dimensional space, lightpainting is inherently a 3 dimensional art (much more alike to dancing than drawing). In lightpainting, the world is your canvas, and the brushstrokes are any sort of motion you can come up with. <br><br>Lightpainting can also be conceived in part as the antithesis of what you might do with oils or watercolor: they depend on light to take on meaning and form, whereas lightpainting only ever works in the dark. A painting in an unlit space isn't a painting to the viewer, and a lightpainting exposed to daylight is just some crazies waving sticks around. But enough metaphor, what is it actually? <br><br>Lightpainting is long exposure photography in a dark setting, paired with light in motion during the span of the shot. The basic anatomy of a lightpainting shoot is a photographer with a camera on a tripod set to optimized parameters taking a 10-30 second photo of one or more lightpainters waving light-tools or "brushes" within the frame and timeframe of the shot. I'm going to break that down for you below to give you an idea of each of the important pieces before you can go out and do it yourself.<br></p>

			<h1 class="title" id="light-tools">Lights</h1>
			<p id="light-tools-text">Every part of lightpainting is in some way an art, and choosing your tools is no different. We at Xenophos built our own tools, but not from scratch. There are a few categories of tools which we built, described below. <br><br></p>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/sticks.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Light Sticks</h2>
				<p class="">These are the some of the simplest and best tools. We bought the lights for about $5 apiece at Fry's electronics and attached them with duct tape to some old wood we cut and sanded to our liking. <br><br></p>
				<h2 class="" id=""><br>The Light Staves</h2>
				<p class="">These are the tools most unique to our work which took a long time to put together. We started with pairs of Cold Cathodes and wired them up to sets of 8 AA batteries each, and a switch, which took a lot of soldering. Then we mounted those structures with hot glue and duct tape onto long rectangular pieces of wood, and added a duct-tape handle. <br><br></p>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/whip.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The EL Whip</h2>
				<p class="">Electrofluorescent wire is used for plenty of lighting applications. In our case, we took a strand of it and cut it into sections, soldered them all together to take power from one source, and mounted that onto a piece of wood which all together resembled a short EL 'whip' of 12 18-inch strands of wire. When we shake them in a shot, they look like static fire. <br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/steel-wool.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Steel Wool Spinner</h2>
				<p class=""> This tool is made from a whisk attached to a cooking spoon by some wire. We put the steel wool (which you can find at your local hardware store) in the whisk and light it with a 9V battery and spin the sparks out. Be careful not to use this tool near highly flammable things! The spinning generates a lot of sparks. Wear Jeans and a sweatshirt when using this tool -- the sparks sting. <br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/floodlight.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Floodlight</h2>
				<p class="">This tool is used to light up the scene entirely, typically for a very brief moment, in order to capture the way things are before changing them. This process is kind of like a camera flash, and in lightpainting, it's a way of cheating by actually getting a static image and then painting on top of it.<br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/orb.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Sphere Tool</h2>
				<p class="">This tool is a few LEDs attached to a string attached to a handle, which when spun while walking in a circle, generates a beautiful orb of color. We've also done this with a fiber optic light instead of an LED at the end of the string. <br><br></p>
			</div>
		</div>		

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/about/tools/saber.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">The Lightsaber</h2>
				<p class="">We didn't modify this tool at all, because it worked exactly the way we wanted it to. Take out those old lightsabers from your childhood and use them to paint with light!<br><br></p>

			<h1 class="title" id="actionTitle">Action</h1>
			<p id="actionText">Each of the tools comes with an implicit effect, and that effect is made by using the tool in the particular way it's built to be used. However, do not be constrained by the way we learned to use our tools. Functional fixedness is not a part of lightpainting, and we discover new ways to use our tools as we go.<br><br>In any case, below I'll describe how we used our tools, and you can borrow our ideas or come up with your own. <br><br></p>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/portfolio/lightpainting/2.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Spinning steel wool</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Take the steel wool out of the bag and rip it apart a little, for better oxygen flow.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Put the steel wool in the whisk. Set the focus for the camera to when you will be spinning. Stand right behind that location.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>3.</b>&nbsp Light the steel wool with a 9V battery by rubbing the battery electrodes against the wool. For best results spend about two seconds rubbing both sides of the wool.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>4.</b>&nbsp Start spinning the wool and start the camera at the same time. Spin hard, but not as hard as you can. Try to stay motionless and only spin your wrist/forearm. Spin the wool in front of you, not right next to you. <br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/portfolio/lightpainting/21.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Orbs</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Set the camera focus. <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Start spinning before you take the photo, with your dominant arm offsef from your body.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>3.</b>&nbsp Once you start the shot, begin walking in a circle around your hand. Try to keep your hand over the same spot on the ground the entire time.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>4.</b>&nbsp Walk until you've completed a half circle, or a full circle for a brighter orb. <br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/portfolio/lightpainting/23.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Freeform light staves</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Set focus.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Use two light staves interpretively. The less you move the more clear you will be in the shot. Release your inner Jedi! <br></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="tool" src="images/portfolio/lightpainting/12.jpg" />
			<div class="tool-text">
				<h2 class="" id="">Arachnids</h2>
				<p class="step"><b>1.</b>&nbsp Set the focus.  <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>2.</b>&nbsp Have someone stand in the center and someone with the floodlight outside of the camera frame but capable of lighting the person up. <br></p>
				<p class="step"><b>3.</b>&nbsp Start the shot and have the person being the arachnid slowly lift their arms around them while the person with the floodlight strobes the light the desired number of times.  <br></p>
			</div>

		<div class="pane">
			<img id="" class="aboutImage" src="images/about/Alex2.jpg" />
			<h1 class="title" id="actionTitle">Setting</h1>
			<div id="settingText">
				<h2 class="" id="">Nature</h2>
				<p class="">Go out into the woods and paint gentle light around trees, meadows, and streams. <br></p>
				<h2 class="" id="">Underground</h2>
				<p class="">We found an extraordinary setting in some local abandoned tunnels plastered with graffiti, which gave our paintings an implicit frame. <br></p>
				<h2 class="" id="">Urban</h2>
				<p class="">These are hard to find but look incredible when lightpainted against. Many of our inspirations (below) make incredible use of these settings. <br></p>

				<p class="" id=""><br>Just one last note: we believe that lightpainting doesn't lend itself too well to solo work. It's a great deal more powerful and meaningful done with others. <br><br>On one level, you need someone behind the camera and someone painting, and performing both at once is challenging. On another level, the complexity of the shot is limited when you only have one painter. But most importantly, art is meant to be shared. It's a vehicle to explore another's consciousness, a way to connect. I've been amazed by some of the paintings my friends had hidden away inside their heads, expressed in a sort of unique dance, a cognitive fingerprint of theirs, of which the traces are superimposed onto one another in the form of an image. We've had so much fun doing this together, and you should too!<br><br></p>
