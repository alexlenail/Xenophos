		<p class="hidden info">Hi, <br><br> My name is Alex and I put together Xenophos and this website. <br><br> I'm a Computer Science major at Tufts University, but that was not where I expected to end up. I've dabbled a little in everything -- I was a nationally ranked Policy Debater in high school and co-founded a foreign affairs journal, but I was also a professional glassblower and photographer. I'm fluent in English, French, and Spanish, as well as C, C++, and Javascript. I decided to major in CS because I think it provides the most direct avenue to catalyze major change in the world, and positively impact the lives of many.</p>

		<p class="hidden info"> Hi, <br><br> I'm Bradford. <br><br> I study neuroscience and computer science at Purdue University. At school, I sing Bass in the Lafayette Chamber Singers and dance competitively with the Purdue Latin and Ballroom Dance Team. When on campus, my research is conducted in the Purdue Molecular Virology lab studying viral assembly with the goal of visualizing viral genome packing and assembly in the complex environment of the cell via electron microscope tomography. When in sunny California, I do research at the UCSF interventional radiology research lab with current focuses on the Magnetically-assisted remote control (MARC) catheter for MRI interventions as well as the ChemoFilter for high-dose chemotherapy delivery via transcatheter intra arterial chemotherapy. <br><br> Current photography interests include timelapse, starscape, MRI portraiture, and lightpainting, In my free time, I like to cook, climb, road and mountain bike, swim, compete in triathlons, backpack, play ultimate Frisbee, and build moderately useful contraptions. I also dabble in jazz piano, bagpipes, and cowbell, though the proficiency of my dabbling is often called into question. I am a huge fan of girls.</p>

		<p class="hidden info">Hey there,<br><br> I'm Max Lenail, one of the photographers in the Xenophos group.<br><br>I am currently a student at Palo Alto High School, where I play soccer and ultimate frisbee, as well as do debate. However, my adventure in light-painting started when I was in Middle school, where I was lucky enough to join a group of awesome people with an awesome idea. <br><br>I've always loved photography. When I was younger, it was an exciting activity to do on vacations, where I would use Kodak disposable cameras to capture anything I found cool or interesting. When I got my first digital camera, I really got into it, and started to not only take photos during trips, but also around the house, or in my neighborhood. It was after my trip to Nicaragua, when I got my first DSLR, that I began to think of photography in a different way, as more than just a convenient way to immortalize memories. I started taking pictures for their artistic value, as opposed to just what was in the frame. <br><br>When my brother, Alex, showed me an online tutorial on how to do basic light-painting, I was thrilled. I thought it would be a great way to learn all the features of my camera, and I was right. We started fooling around with glow-sticks and flashlights, and soon discovered that we had found something really special. Alex got a group of his friends together, built some awesome tools, and the rest is in our photos. In the end, I am so grateful and happy that I was a part of this group, as I wouldn't be half the photographer I am today without it. </p>

		<p class="hidden info">Hi, <br><br>I'm Anna. <br><br>Art became a chief interest of mine after my father left me in my room with a box of acrylic paints and found me hours later surrounded by four walls covered in mini-murals dictated by my overzealous imagination. Since then, my medium has narrowed to digital art; designing, photographing and writing for an assortment of newspapers and magazines has sharpened my interests. Over the past two years, working with the Xenophos crew has greatly developed not only my passion but also my experience as a photographer. Before Xenophos, I never would have considered photography to be a group effort, but our productive teamwork and friendship show how working together allows us to develop from each other. <br><br>Here at the George Washington University, I study Anthropology and Fine Arts. I also write and design for the GW Hatchet, bringing my current studies inside and outside of the classroom back to art.</p>

		<p class="hidden info">Hi,<br><br>I'm Masha.<br><br>I’ve been visually inclined since I was five years old, when I was better at understanding Art Nouveau books than I was at English. In 8th grade I picked up my mom’s Konica Minolta with all of its endless buttons, and thus began my adventures with SLRs. I’ve dabbled into darkroom photography, Photoshop, and a variety of exposure techniques, also growing a parallel affinity for design, as I created little projects in Illustrator and worked on putting together an arts magazine. Somewhere in there at an art show, I met Alex and Bradford who drew me in to be fascinated with light manipulation and all of the ideas, laughs, and frozen yogurt trips that came along with it. My work with Xenophos brought me delight, skill, and direction to my current project—college, that is. I now study Cognitive Science and Design at UC Berkeley, with a focus in human-centered design and innovation.</p>

			<p class="inspiration info" id="GDt">Hi, I'm Greg.<br><br>I am a student at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. My professional interests include issues of computer networking and security, but I mainly provide logistical support to Xenophos, helping to get things in the right place at the right time, working correctly. Additionally, I do some work exploring locations for projects, generally in Northern California. Much of what I do consists of working with things of very limited aesthetic value--texts, journals, and essays relating to abstract and generally intangible subjects. Since much of what I do is so colorless, working with Xenophos is as much a way to balance my life as it is a way to advance photography.</p>

On campus, I am a student technician in the Computer Science department and helped found a Renewable Energy think tank.  I am both manager and tenor in the South Asian-American fusion a Capella group Barsaat and help plan Brown's student events in the Special Events Committee.  In my free time, I take photos, play guitar, and dabble in squash and ultimate frisbee (though I played baseball through high school).  I'm also a huge fan of girls.</p>

			<p class="TrioInfo">Hi, I'm Paige.<br><br>I am seeking a degree in Earth Science from California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. I have always aspired to be a geologist, from the age of 4, when I told my dad I wanted to study rocks for the rest of my life. <br><br> But as I grew up, my passion for other things grew as well. I have been highly involved in the choir program in every school I have attended since elementary school, and other art mediums (painting, drawing and sculpture) have also become a primary hobby of mine in past years. It was a great joy to participate in this project, for it truly brought the art and other elements included to life. </p>
