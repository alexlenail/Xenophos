XENOPHOS
========

[xenophos.org](http://xenophos.org/) source code

I wanted to build our website more or less from scratch. I didn't want to use a gallery plugin or any especially high level framework. I believe that artists are both empowered and constrained by the tools they use, so they need to take great care in choosing the right ones. 

I'm writing this website in CoffeeScript, using jQuery and CSS3 for animations. You'll find the code I think is interesting in the 'coffee' directory.

Note: if you fork this directory, very little or none of the code will work because I didn't upload the source images to github.
